# TableViewDeleteRowDemo
Swift - Swift TableView Delete Row Demo - Demo 11 of 30

App created in Xcode 10.3 (10G8) using Swift 4.2, iOS Deployment Target 12.4 and tested on a iPhone Xr Emulator

In this demo app we demonstrate how to code a swift Table View Delete Row Demo app.

When the user clicks the icon they are taken right into the app. They are greeted on top with a label that displays the
app title "Table View Delete Row Demo". Then right below is a Table View populated with cells that show a shopping list of
various items. This app gives the user two ways to delete contents from a row.

The first way to delete contents is to just swipe a little bit from the right to the left. A red 'Delete' button will
appear that when clicked will delete the row causing the other rows to move up a row so there is no blank gap. The second
ways to delete contents is to just swipe all the way across from right to left which will create a 'Delete' titled red
swipe that when completed will delete the contents from the row which will cause the rows to move up a row so there is no 
blank gap.
